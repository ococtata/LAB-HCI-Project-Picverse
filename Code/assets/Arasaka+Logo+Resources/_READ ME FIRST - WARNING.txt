---Thanks and Rules---

Thanks for downloading this file! I really appreciate the folks checking out the site and I hope you enjoy using the file or if you just wanted to see what was in it, I hope it meets your expectations! A special thanks also to Eli, Madqueen, & Nikolay for helping me on several of the logos found on this page.

////// It's my duty to remind you that these are not for commercial usage. All of the logos here are the intellectual property of CD Projekt Red and are therefore not to be used in commercial applications at all. Don't sell it or use it in something that you are going to sell! If you do, you will be subject to the copyright laws of your country and may face legal action and fees. 

Also, companies: Stop using these as a substitute for official files! I'm flattered, but there are differences between my logos and the official ones that can break your contract. In the event that you do, however, remember that you must attribute me, AS PER MY AGREEMENT WITH CD PROJEKT RED. I've got a direct line to legal as they were kind enough to allow me to have this project in the first place. Just use theirs, it's easier and much more official!

Use these logos to add a bit of realism to your fan pieces as well as any sort of cosplay you're thinking of doing for your favorite Con or event. There are lots of uses out there for these and I hope they come in handy. I always love seeing where these go, so feel free to send a picture our way:
